## üìå Project Overview

Combined Heat and Power (CHP), or cogeneration, generates electricity and usable heat simultaneously. This project integrates:

- 3D modeling and simulation of CHP systems
- Waste heat utilization and energy recovery
- Advanced carbon capture techniques
- Multiphysics experimentation and emissions analysis

## üß† Problem Statement

Traditional energy systems discharge large amounts of heat and pollutants. CHP systems can mitigate this waste, but limitations remain in optimizing fuel use, turbine performance, and emissions control. There is a pressing need for integrated design and simulation approaches to address these inefficiencies.
