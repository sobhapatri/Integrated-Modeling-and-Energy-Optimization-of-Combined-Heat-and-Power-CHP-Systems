#  Integrated Modeling and Energy Optimization of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems

This project focuses on improving the thermal and environmental efficiency of CHP systems through advanced modeling, simulation, and carbon capture integration. 

---

##  Project Overview

Combined Heat and Power (CHP), or cogeneration, generates electricity and usable heat simultaneously. This project integrates:

- 3D modeling and simulation of CHP systems
- Waste heat utilization and energy recovery
- Advanced carbon capture techniques
- Multiphysics experimentation and emissions analysis

---

##  Problem Statement

Traditional energy systems discharge large amounts of heat and pollutants. CHP systems can mitigate this waste, but limitations remain in optimizing fuel use, turbine performance, and emissions control. There is a pressing need for integrated design and simulation approaches to address these inefficiencies.

##  Solution Approach

- Modeled and simulated a complete CHP system in **SOLIDWORKS** and **ANSYS**
- Integrated **Phase Change Materials (PCMs)** and optimized piping geometry to enhance waste heat recovery
- Conducted **Design of Experiments (DoE)** to evaluate advanced **carbon capture** strategies
- Analyzed emission metrics and energy balances across baseline and optimized systems
